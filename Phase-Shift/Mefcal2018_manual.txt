Syntax:

mefcal2018 inputfilename	generates outputfile: inputfilename.out

 
Input (free format):

iz,amass	charge and mass number target

rk,model,nq	cut-off radius, model for charge distribution, number of FB coefficients
		model=0: give nq FB coefficients
		model=1: give c,z,w of three-parameter Fermi distribution
		model=2: give ground-state charge distribution from 0 to rk in 0.1 fm steps
		oher models, such as Gauss still to be added

e,ewidth	energy and width of beam (e<0: stop)
		if ewidth<0 no correction for solid angle and energy-width contributions,
		(skip next 2 input lines)
			several of these parameters are specific for the Nikhef set-up
			in practice only dthe (see below) is important

deng,disp	energy acceptation (Mev) and energy dispersion on target (mrad/Mev)

tardik,dthe,dphi,witar
		tardik = target thickness (g/cm2)
		horizontal acceptance of spectrometer (deg)
		vertical acceptance of spectrometer (deg)
		target angle (deg)
			= -2 effective thickness given, no correction
			= -1 target in reflection
			= 0 target in transmission
			> 0 target angle fixed to witar

wimi,wima,dwc	minimum and maximum scattering angle and angle step
